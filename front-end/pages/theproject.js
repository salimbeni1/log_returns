      Correlation between stock prices gives powerful insights into the evolution of financial systems
      in interesting periods: during a financial crisis, political instability, or significant economic
      development of a country. Correlation tells us a lot about how stocks are linked, such as how
      industries are dependent on or independent of crisis or development in specific economic sectors.
      The goal of this visualization is to represent the evolution in time of correlation, hierarchies
      and clustering of various financial stocks.

      One area of particular interest in FX trading is to identify which ,if any, 
      of the currencies are in play during a given period of time. More precisely,
      we are interested in understanding whether particular currencies appear to be assuming
      a dominant or dependent role within the network, and how this changes over time. Since
      exchange rates are always quoted in terms of the price of one currency compared to another, 
      this is a highly non-trivial task.

      Since the MST contains only a subset of the information from the correlation matrix, 
      it cannot tell us anything which we could not ,in principle, obtain by analyzing the matrix 
      C itself. However, as with all statistical tools, the hope is that it can provide an insight 
      into the system s overall behavior which would not be so readily obtained from the ,large, correlation 
      matrix itself.
