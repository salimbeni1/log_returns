  Correlation between stock prices gives powerful insights into the evolution of financial systems in interesting periods: during a financial crisis, political instability, or significant economic development of a country. Correlation tells us a lot about how stocks are linked, such as how industries are dependent on or independent of crisis or development in specific economic sectors. The goal of this visualization is to represent the evolution in time of correlation, hierarchies and clustering of various financial stocks.
